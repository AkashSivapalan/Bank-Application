# Bank-Application
This program is bank application that processes transactions for customers. There is login page for either a customer or manager to login. To login into the manager portal, the username and password is "admin" and the the role "manager". Logging into managers can add and deletes customers. Adding a new customer gives them an initial $100 to their account. Each customer added will have their own text file which is used for login and thus customer from customer info will be stored after closing program and can be accessed again. To login into a customer, type in a username with the corresponding password and with "customer" for role. Logging in to a customer will allow the customer to deposit, withdraw, or make an purchase while updating the user's information in the textfile. Customers are also assigned ranks based on their bank balance. Their ranks determine the additional fees they receive when making purchases.
